# sdk_includes

This directory contains minimal set of Xash3D FWGS headers,
so you can include them in your project that may have completely incompatible
set of headers (like halflife-updated, or original HLSDK for example).

Contents of sdk_includes automatically generated with copy.sh shell script.
Run it from this folder, in context of engine build, to automatically synchronize
selected headers.

As this contains proprietary Valve headers, the amount of headers needed for menu
must be reduced at some point.
